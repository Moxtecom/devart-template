Google Art and Play by Moxte.com



Imagine that any art object can be interactive, anyone can de involved in performance. Imagine museums or exhibitions where artworks transform into games and games transform into art. We started that experiment. Black and white picture is not only an image, but level, where black color disappears and the white one creates terrain. Player can modify it with the help of his own fingers. The idea is to create a proper path for Yin and Yang symbol to the final destination. After the work is done, the game begins. Yin and Yang symbol moves leading by physical forces. Player is able to correct mistakes by slowing the time.
